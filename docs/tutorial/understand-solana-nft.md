# Understanding NFTs on Solana

This guide will help you to learn the basic of tokens on Solana through building a simple token program on the Solana network and interact with it using the JavaScript client. It does not assume prior knowledge of Solana, but it does require some basic programming in [Rust](https://rustlang.org). Although it will briefly explain Solana, you are encourage to learn more by reading [How Solana Works](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/overview) and  [Programming on Solana - An Introduction
](https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/), and the [whitepaper](http://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf).

## The basic of Solana

Solana is an innovative blockchain with some key innovations such as [Proof of History (POH)](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274) and parallel smart contracts run-time to achieve faster, near-instant consensus.

Solana smart contracts are called programs. On Solana, **everything is a program** all the way down. The System Program owns all SOL accounts and other programs, including the Token Program and user-space programs written by us developers.

The focus of this tutorial will be the Token Program in order to understand how to build an NFT program, but in the process it hopefully will give you a better understanding of the platform over all.

## Setting up

To begin this journey, first install:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Use one of the later LTS versions)

Run a test validator locally using the newly install CLI with

```shell
solana-test-validator
> Ledger location: test-ledger
> Log: test-ledger/validator.log
> Identity: 9U8Yk9fEq6hCvaDVtLSSFk5keJUpNutydW1f8LvfAHJf
> Genesis Hash: 5JLFXnecEaDHkkPZRbcN8LoGDPiz6QNLpKDLnB5JA6CF
> Version: 1.8.2
> Shred Version: 44427
> Gossip Address: 127.0.0.1:1024
> TPU Address: 127.0.0.1:1027
> JSON RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8899
> таж 00:01:29 | Processed Slot: 181 | Confirmed Slot: 181 | Finalized Slot: 149 | S
```

Note the JSON RPC URL listening port. Target the running validator node with the Solana CLI:

```shell
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
> Config File: /Users/pancy/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
> RPC URL: http://localhost:8899
> WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:8900/ (computed)
> Keypair Path: /Users/pancy/.config/solana/id.json
> Commitment: confirmed
```

Now create a Node project we will be using to interact with our on-chain token program by typing the following:

```shell
mkdir filet
cd filet
npm init -y
npm install @solana/web3.js
```

Let's trying to connect to the running Solana validator on port 8899 as a client using the Node REPL by typing the following:

```shell
node --experimental-repl-await
> Welcome to Node.js v14.18.1.
>> const { Connection } = await import("@solana/web3.js")
>> const connection = new Connection("http://localhost:8899", "confirmed")
>> const version = await connection.getVersion()
>> version["solana-core"]
> '1.8.2'
```

If the version was printed out on the prompt for you, you are successfully connected!

## Creating an NFT program

Start a project with `cargo new filet --lib`. Then open the project's manifest file `filet/Cargo.toml` and add:

```toml
[features]
no-entrypoint = []

[dependencies]
solana-program = "=1.10.2"

[dev-dependencies]
solana-sdk = "=1.10.2"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

Pay special attention to the `[features]` and `[lib]` attributes. Run `cargo update` within the project directory to update the dependencies.

Use an editor to open your project and navigate to the `/src/lib.rs`, remove all the existing code, and add the following to the file:

```rust
use solana_program::{
  msg, entrypoint, entrypoint::ProgramResult,
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);
fn process_instruction(
  program_id: &Pubkey,
  accounts: &[AccountInfo],
  instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
  todo!("Not yet know what I'm doing");
}
```
